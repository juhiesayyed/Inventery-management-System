# INVENTORY MANAGEMNT SYSTEM

##### This is the Project of Inventory management system named "Invento". The meaning of word inventory is supply or stock of something, whereas inventory management system is an approach for keeping track of the flow of inventory. 
##### In our system, where user can manage the stocks efficiently without much manual or paper work Functions performed by this system will include adding items to stock, displaying list of stock and searching specific items in stock. 
##### For making this project, I have used Java programming language in that I have used it's concepts like package, files, exception, string buffer and others were used. 
##### For the GUI part Swing is used. Swing is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit that includes the GUI components. Also it provides a rich set of widgets and packages to make sophisticated GUI components for Java applications. 

## Feature of Proposed System: 
#####  Add item in the system 
#####  Can see the items which is stored in the system 
#####  Can search an item from the list of items 
#####  Provide printout of the inventory product list 
#####  Provide the softcopy of the Inventory Product list which can be send to any devices 

## Design and Implementation Constraints: 
#####  Programming Language: Java
#####  GUI : Swing (Swing in java is part of Java foundation class) 
#####  For storing data: Files

## System Features 
#####  Save Time 
#####  Efficient management 
#####  User Friendly interface
